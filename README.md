# New FPV Pilot Guide

This is intended to be a guide for new/beginner FPV pilots to know where to focus their time and to check things off to get their first flight under their belt. It also provides a set of resources for those things and gives some indication of where to aim for future progress, and what might be a waste of time to learn early.


Note: This is not intended to be a set of guides of how to do each task, only a single guide with minimal updates needed over time. Individual links off of the main guide page should only contain links to videos formatted as an image link with the thumbnail.
