# New FPV Pilot Guide

This is intended to be a guide for new/beginner FPV pilots to know where to focus their time and to check things off to get their first flight under their belt. It also provides a set of resources for those things and gives some indication of where to aim for future progress, and what might be best to save for later on in your FPV progress.
