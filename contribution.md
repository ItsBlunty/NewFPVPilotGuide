Thanks for contributing to this guide!

Acceptable PRs will contain either:

* Changes to the Home Wiki page that seem relevant to a new pilot and keep to somewhat condesed descriptions
* Additional Pages that contain links to topics brought up in the main guide.

Additional Pages should use image links to useful videos (please check a current Additional Page for sizing and formatting examples), or text links with a short description to useful text guides or websites.

Please Note: No additional pages will be accepted that are written as guides on this wiki, only links and text describing the links will be allowed to offsite information or guides.
